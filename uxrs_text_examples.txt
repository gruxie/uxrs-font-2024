UX Research and Strategy is a registered 501c3 organization, and was founded by three former co-workers who saw a gap in a local UX market. Based on community feedback, they formed a group that is dedicated to teaching topics in UX research and strategy. 

UXRS is dedicated to making UX research and strategy topics approachable and actionable. We create a space for people to engage and learn from each other.

Our hope for this group is to enrich and complement the User Experience Design community, in the DFW and beyond, through knowledge sharing, outreach and partnership. 
We saw that there was a gap that needed to be filled in the UX community. We stepped in to fill it. We are devoted to teaching and exploring topics related to UX Research and Strategy. â€‹
Whether you are new to the field, or always evolving in your career, we want to help others on their journey to be strong professionals in UX Research and Strategy disciplines.

"I learn a lot from the speakers. I can't believe you let me attend this for free."

"I attend for a few reasons, But one is that was motivational and inspiring to see your expertise, passions, ambitions and hard work in action."
